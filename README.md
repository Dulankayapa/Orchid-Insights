Project Overview (Orchid Insights - Application to monitor the health aspect in hydroponics farming)

Orchid Insights is an intelligent, IoT-enabled monitoring application designed to assess and improve the health of orchids cultivated in hydroponic farming systems. Orchids are highly sensitive plants that require precise environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, water pH, and nutrient concentration. Even minor deviations can lead to stress, disease, and reduced flowering quality.
The project addresses the limitations of traditional manual monitoring methods by introducing a real-time, automated solution. It integrates environmental sensors, image processing, and machine learning techniques to continuously monitor growing conditions and detect early signs of plant stress, pests, or diseases. Sensor data and plant images are analyzed to generate health scores, alerts, and actionable care recommendations.The system is accessible through a user-friendly mobile or web dashboard, allowing growers to visualize environmental trends, track plant growth, and receive personalized care guidance. Orchid Insights supports sustainable hydroponic farming by reducing plant loss, minimizing resource waste, and enabling data-driven decision-making for both novice and experienced growers.

Project History

Farming has evolved over the past few decades as a modern agricultural technique that enables plant cultivation without soil, using nutrient-rich water solutions. This method gained popularity due to its efficient use of water, space, and nutrients, especially in controlled environments such as greenhouses and urban farms. As technology advanced, hydroponics began integrating basic automation and sensor-based monitoring to improve crop yield and consistency.

Orchids, known for their high ornamental and commercial value, have increasingly been grown using hydroponic systems because of their sensitivity to soil-borne diseases and their need for precise environmental control. Traditionally, orchid growers relied on manual observation and experience to manage conditions such as temperature, humidity, light, and nutrient balance. However, these methods are time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error, often resulting in delayed detection of plant stress or disease.

With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), real-time environmental monitoring became possible through affordable sensors and embedded systems. More recently, artificial intelligence and image processing technologies have been introduced into agriculture to detect plant diseases, predict stress conditions, and optimize growth. Despite these advancements, most existing solutions are generalized for common crops and lack orchid-specific intelligence.

The Orchid Insights project emerged to address this gap by combining hydroponic technology, IoT-based environmental monitoring, and AI-driven plant health analysis tailored specifically for orchids. This project builds upon existing smart agriculture research while introducing orchid-focused diagnostics and personalized care recommendations, marking a step forward in precision horticulture and sustainable farming practices.
